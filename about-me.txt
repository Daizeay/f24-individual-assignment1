I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a  
BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like (some) superheroes and puzzles. I solve my NYT Games deck first thing in the morning.
Just like most basic people, I like hiking and you can find me somewhere in the Linville 
Gorge on most weekends. I also like history tidbits (ask me about my favorite podcasts). I'm 
currently reading "Failure Is An Option" by H. Jon Benjamin (Bob's Burgers)
This is the way.
